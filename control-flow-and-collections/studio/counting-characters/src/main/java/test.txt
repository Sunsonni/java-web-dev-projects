La, la la, la la la la la
La, la la, la la la la la
I don't need no one, two, three, not bourgeoisie, I'll step in
Know just how to make a scene, just me myself my best friends
Uh-huh, I like it, it's simple as that
That's right, uh-huh
I like it, I keep coming back
I don't need nobody tryna tell me how to run it
Found myself some baddies 'bout to turn it to a hundred
Uh-huh, they like it, it's simple as that
That's right, uh-huh, they like it, they keep coming back
Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin' babe we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come thru
We can run it run it run it no this ain't a debut
Love me once I know you'll love me twice
Love me once the naughty turns to nice
La, la la, la la la la la
I don't need no cookie cutter perfect ordinary
Can find me under ride or die inside that dictionary
Babe, uh-huh, they like it, it's simple as that
That's right, uh-huh, they like it, they keep coming back
Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin' babe we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come thru
We can run it run it run it no this ain't a debut
Love me once I know you'll love me twice
Love me once the naughty turns to nice
Oh, we-ee-ee ain't flexin' babe, we do what we do
Wanna pull up on us? Check in at the gate and come thru
We can run it run it run it no this ain't a debut
Love me once I know you'll love me twice
Love me once the naughty turns to nice
La, la la, la la la la la
La, la la, la, love me once I know you'll love me twice
La, la la, la la la la la
Love me once I know you'll love me twice
Love me once it's time to roll the dice
